We also talked about TST vs Tries... I might try it out with Tries but I'm not sure. |
| Jan 8th  |  6:30-7pm  |                                                                                                                                                           I spent some time re-familiarizing myself with my old BFS and Trie algorithms. I looked  at what needed to be changed. I changed the size to the size of the alphabet. |

| Jan 10th |   class    |                                                                                                                     I created a method in my tst file to access the next node in the tst. This allows me to keep track of where i am in the TST while doing DFS (i'm passing that information in as part of my recursive calls). |
| Jan 12th | 3;45-4:15  | I'm wasn't accessing the next node correctly in my tst -- I was just getting the next node to the left or right not actually the next node that matched with my next letter. I fixed that and realized my last letter was being chopped off when adding words to the goodWords array. I have to figure out the repeat issue now. |
