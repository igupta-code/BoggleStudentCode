| Jan 7th | 11:30-12pm |          In class we discussed a bit about if we should use BFS and a TST or not. We also talked about TST vs Tries... I might try it out with Tries but I'm not sure. |
| Jan 8th |  6:30-7pm  | I spent some time re-familiarizing myself with my old BFS and Trie algorithms. I looked  at what needed to be changed. I changed the size to the size of the alphabet. |
| Jan 9th | 9:20-10pm  |                                                                             Started some programming: I set up the TST file and created an outline of where I'm going. |
