| Jan 7th  | 11:30-12pm |                                                                                                                                                                  In class we discussed a bit about if we should use BFS and a TST or not. We also talked about TST vs Tries... I might try it out with Tries but I'm not sure. |
| Jan 8th  |  6:30-7pm  |                                                                                                                                                         I spent some time re-familiarizing myself with my old BFS and Trie algorithms. I looked  at what needed to be changed. I changed the size to the size of the alphabet. |
| Jan 9th  | 9:20-10pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Started some programming: I set up the TST file and created an outline of where I'm going. |
| Jan 10th |   class    |                                                                                                                   I created a method in my tst file to access the next node in the tst. This allows me to keep track of where i am in the TST while doing DFS (i'm passing that information in as part of my recursive calls). |
| Jan 12th | 3;45-4:15  | I wasn't accessing the next node correctly in my tst -- I was just getting the next node to the left or right not actually the next node that matched with my next letter. I fixed that and realized my last letter was being chopped off when adding words to the goodWords array. I have to figure out the repeat issue now. |
| Jan 12th | 4:15-4:55  |                                                                                                                                                             I resolved the duplicate issue for the first two test cases, but I am missing some words in the bigger test cases. I'm using the debugger but am not sure why yet. |
| Jan 12th | 5:30-6:30  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   After trying to debug for so long I think i might just not pass in the node. |
